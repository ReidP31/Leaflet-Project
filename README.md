For this Project, I created a Leaflet Map that displays geoJSON data from the US Geological Survey's Earthquake Data API for the last 7 days.

* Fully interactive map with pop-ups for each earthquake

* Earthquakes of a magnitude of 5 or greater are exponentially larger than those that are magnitude less than 5
