# USGS Earthquake Map

For this Project, I created a Leaflet Map that displays geoJSON data from the US Geological Survey's Earthquake Data API for the last 7 days.

## Project Features

* Fully interactive map with pop-ups for each earthquake

* Earthquake markers are colored according to a scale, with the smallest earthquakes marked by a light green and the strongest by a dark red

* Earthquakes of a magnitude of 5 or greater are exponentially larger than those that are magnitude less than 5


## Instructions for running on your local machine

2. Navigate to the directory that contains the index.html file

3. Run a local web server (you can find some super simple instructions <a href='https://mrcoles.com/how-start-local-web-server-view-html-files/' target="_blank">here</a>)

4. Open a browser tab on your internet browser and type in the local host address you used to run the local web server
